# TXCCleanReporter
A XCTests reporter that prints a clean summary of the tests

## Instalation
All that you have to do is to Drag&Drop the folder CleanTestsObserver into your tests target.
Make sure to set the files as members of Tests target.

## Usage
Just run the tests as usually. The only thing that will differ is the output on console. :)
